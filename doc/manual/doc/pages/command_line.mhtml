Running from the Command Line
-----------------------------

The main binary can be used to launch games from the command line, without invoking the GUI.  For example, if you installed MAME OS X in `/Applications`, then the main binary is at:

    /Applications/MAME OS X.app/Contents/MacOS/MAME OS X

Any preference can be passed as options to this executable.  For example, you could launch Ms. Pac-Man using the following command:

    MAME OS X -Game mspacman

### Common Options

Here are some common options:

<dl class>
  <dt class="option">-Game <i>shortname</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Run the specified game, using the short name.
  </dd>
  <dt class="option">-FullScreen <i>YES/NO</i></dt>
  <dd>
    When set to <i>YES</i>, runs the game in full screen.
  </dd>
</dl>
