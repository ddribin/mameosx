Using the mameosx-util Tool
---------------------------

`mameosx-util` is a command line program that prints information about the games for front-end authors.  The binary is included inside the standard application bundle, under the MacOS directory.  For example, if you installed MAME OS X in `/Applications`, then the binary is at:

    /Applications/MAME OS X.app/Contents/MacOS/mameosx-util

This command has the following usage:

    mameosx-util [OPTIONS] [<gamename|wildcard>]

The options are summarized in this table:

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--listxml</td>
    <td>
      List comprehensive details for all of the supported games. The
      output is quite long, so it is usually better to redirect this
      into a file.  The output is in XML format. By default all games
      are listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a
      driver name or wildcard after the --listxml command.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--listfull</td>
    <td>
      Displays a list of game driver names and descriptions. By default
      all games are listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a
      driver name or wildcard after the --listfull command

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--listsource</td>
    <td>
    	Displays a list of drivers and the names of the source files their game
    	drivers live in. Useful for finding which driver a game runs on in 
    	order to fix bugs. By default all games are listed; however, you can 
    	limit this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard after the 
    	--listsource command.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>--listclones</td>
